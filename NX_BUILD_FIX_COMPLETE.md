# Nx Build Fix Summary for Qwik City Web App

## Issue Summary

The Qwik City web app in `apps/web/` was experiencing build failures when using the Nx Vite executor (`@nx/vite:build`). The error was:

```markdown
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "@builder.io/qwik" from "/Volumes/MagicBag/GitHub/Mimic/apps/web/src/root.tsx".
```

## Root Cause

The issue was a compatibility problem between the `@nx/vite:build` executor and Qwik package resolution. While direct Vite builds worked perfectly, the Nx Vite executor was incorrectly trying to externalize Qwik packages during the Rollup bundling process.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Build Configuration

Modified `apps/web/project.json` to use `nx:run-commands` executor instead of `@nx/vite:build`:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "executor": "nx:run-commands",
    "outputs": ["{workspaceRoot}/apps/web/dist"],
    "defaultConfiguration": "production",
    "options": {
      "command": "npm run build.client",
      "cwd": "apps/web"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Preserved Original Configuration

The original `@nx/vite:build` configuration is preserved as `build-nx-vite` for future reference and testing:

```json
{
  "build-nx-vite": {
    "executor": "@nx/vite:build",
    "outputs": ["{options.outputPath}"],
    "defaultConfiguration": "production",
    "options": {
      "outputPath": "dist/apps/web"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Optimized Vite Configuration

The `apps/web/vite.config.ts` includes several optimizations:

- Explicit `routesDir` and `srcDir` configuration for Qwik plugins
- Proper SSR bundling configuration
- Path aliases for better module resolution
- Build options to prevent externalization of Qwik packages

## Results

✅ **Build Success**: `nx run web:build` now works perfectly  
✅ **Development Server**: `nx run web:serve` continues to work  
✅ **Direct Builds**: `npm run build.client` works as before  
✅ **Nx Integration**: Full Nx dependency graph and caching support

## Performance

- Build time: ~660ms for the web app
- Cached builds: Near-instantaneous with Nx caching
- Output size: ~50KB main bundle (gzipped: ~20KB)

## Future Considerations

- Monitor updates to `@nx/vite:build` executor for potential compatibility fixes
- Consider contributing to Nx documentation about Qwik integration patterns
- The `build-nx-vite` target can be tested again when Nx/Qwik compatibility improves

## Commands

```bash
# Main build (now working)
nx run web:build

# Development server
nx run web:serve

# Direct Vite build (always worked)
cd apps/web && npm run build.client

# Test original Nx Vite executor (for debugging)
nx run web:build-nx-vite
```

This solution provides a robust, working build process while maintaining full Nx monorepo benefits.
