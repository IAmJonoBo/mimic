# Mimic 2.0 Sprint Roadmap

Two-week sprints tailored for the Mimic 2.0 rewrite. Each sprint now calls out mission, workstreams,
architecture/tooling upgrades, quality gates, and exit checklists so squads can execute against
consistent expectations. Partner this roadmap with
[`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_2.0.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_2.0.md) for deeper architectural context.

## Baseline Quality Gates

The following checks are mandatory for every sprint increment. Treat them as entry and exit criteria
for stories as well as sprint reviews:

- `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm lint:workspace`, and `pnpm typecheck` green with no warnings gated by
  waivers.
- Functional/contract suites (`pnpm nx run-many -t test`, Storybook interaction runner, Playwright
  journeys) stable with flake budgets logged.
- Visual regression baselines (Loki, Compose/SwiftUI snapshots) updated and reviewed.
- `pnpm build` + package-specific builds successful in CI.
- Security posture verified via `pnpm audit`, Scorecard, Trivy, Cargo Audit.
- Telemetry dashboards and runbooks updated when new signals are added.

Use Sprint 0 to unblock any failing gates so later sprints start from a trusted baseline.
