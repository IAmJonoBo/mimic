## ADR-001: Monorepo Structure with Nx

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2024-01-15

### Context

We need to manage multiple related packages (design tokens, component library, utilities) that share dependencies and
require coordinated releases. Options considered:

1. **Separate repositories** - Simple but coordination overhead
2. **Lerna monorepo** - Traditional choice but maintenance burden
3. **Nx monorepo** - Modern tooling with intelligent builds
4. **Rush monorepo** - Microsoft's solution but less ecosystem support

### Decision

Use Nx for monorepo management with pnpm workspaces.

### Rationale

- **Intelligent builds**: Only rebuilds affected packages
- **Task orchestration**: Parallel execution with dependency awareness
- **Caching**: Local and remote caching for CI/CD acceleration
- **Code generation**: Consistent project structure and scaffolding
- **Graph visualization**: Dependency analysis and optimization
- **Active ecosystem**: Strong community and regular updates

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Fast incremental builds
- Consistent tooling across packages
- Excellent developer experience
- Strong TypeScript integration

**Negative:**

- Learning curve for Nx concepts
- Some vendor lock-in to Nx ecosystem
- Configuration complexity for advanced features

**Mitigation:**

- Comprehensive documentation and training
- Gradual adoption of advanced features
- Regular Nx updates to avoid technical debt

## ADR-002: Design Token Management with Style Dictionary

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2024-01-15

### Context

Design tokens need to be transformed from design tool exports into multiple platform-specific formats. Options
evaluated:

1. **Manual CSS variables** - Simple but no transformation pipeline
2. **Sass/Less variables** - Limited platform support
3. **Style Dictionary** - Industry standard with extensible transforms
4. **Theo (Salesforce)** - Powerful but complex setup
5. **Custom build scripts** - Full control but maintenance burden

### Decision

Use Style Dictionary as the primary token transformation tool.

### Rationale

- **Multi-platform output**: CSS, JS, iOS, Android, etc.
- **W3C DTCG compliance**: Future-proof token format
- **Extensible transforms**: Custom formats and transformations
- **JSON-based**: Human-readable and version-controllable
- **Industry adoption**: Used by major design systems
- **Active maintenance**: Regular updates and community support

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Standardized token format across platforms
- Automated generation of platform-specific assets
- Easy integration with design tools
- Consistent naming and structure

**Negative:**

- Additional build step complexity
- Learning curve for configuration
- Dependency on external tool

**Mitigation:**

- Well-documented configuration
- Automated testing of token builds
- Fallback to manual processes if needed

## ADR-003: Qwik for Component Library

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2024-01-15

### Context

Need a modern framework for building performant, reusable components. Considered options:

1. **React** - Ecosystem leader but hydration performance issues
2. **Vue** - Good performance but smaller ecosystem
3. **Svelte** - Compile-time optimizations but limited SSR
4. **Qwik** - Resumability and optimal performance
5. **Lit** - Web standards but limited framework integration
6. **Stencil** - Framework agnostic but compilation complexity

### Decision

Use Qwik for the component library implementation.

### Rationale

- **Resumability**: No hydration overhead, instant interactivity
- **Fine-grained reactivity**: Optimal re-rendering performance
- **Small bundles**: Automatic code splitting and lazy loading
- **SSR/SSG support**: Excellent server-side rendering
- **Framework interop**: Can be used with React, Vue, etc.
- **Future-proof**: Built for modern web standards

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Exceptional runtime performance
- Minimal JavaScript bundle sizes
- Great developer experience
- Strong TypeScript support

**Negative:**

- Smaller ecosystem compared to React/Vue
- Learning curve for resumability concepts
- Limited third-party component libraries

**Mitigation:**

- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Gradual migration path from other frameworks
- Focus on building comprehensive component library

## ADR-004: pnpm as Package Manager

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2024-01-15

### Context

Monorepo requires efficient dependency management with workspace support. Options:

1. **npm** - Universal but slow and disk-intensive
2. **yarn v1** - Fast but maintenance mode
3. **yarn v2+** - Modern features but compatibility issues
4. **pnpm** - Fast, efficient, great monorepo support

### Decision

Use pnpm as the primary package manager.

### Rationale

- **Disk efficiency**: Symlinked dependencies save space
- **Performance**: Faster installs than npm/yarn
- **Monorepo support**: Native workspace features
- **Strict dependencies**: Prevents phantom dependencies
- **Compatibility**: Works with existing npm ecosystem
- **Active development**: Regular improvements and features

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Faster CI/CD builds
- Reduced disk usage
- Better dependency isolation
- Excellent workspace management

**Negative:**

- Less universal than npm
- Potential compatibility issues with some tools
- Team needs to learn pnpm specifics

**Mitigation:**

- Document pnpm setup and usage
- Provide fallback npm instructions
- Use pnpm in CI/CD for consistency

## ADR-005: Vanilla Extract for Styling

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2024-01-15

### Context

Components need type-safe, performant styling that integrates with design tokens. Options:

1. **CSS Modules** - Scoped styles but no type safety
2. **Styled Components** - Runtime CSS-in-JS performance cost
3. **Emotion** - Popular but runtime overhead
4. **Vanilla Extract** - Zero-runtime CSS-in-JS with types
5. **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first but limited customization
6. **Plain CSS** - Universal but no type safety or colocated styles

### Decision

Use Vanilla Extract for component styling.

### Rationale

- **Zero runtime**: CSS extracted at build time
- **Type safety**: TypeScript integration and design token types
- **Colocated styles**: Styles near components but optimized CSS output
- **Design token integration**: Native support for token-based styling
- **Framework agnostic**: Works with any framework
- **Performance**: No runtime style injection

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Excellent performance with type safety
- Great integration with design tokens
- No runtime style overhead
- Full TypeScript support

**Negative:**

- Less ecosystem compared to styled-components
- Build-time complexity
- Learning curve for TypeScript styles

**Mitigation:**

- Comprehensive style system documentation

2. **TypeScript** - Strong typing with good ecosystem support
3. **Flow** - Facebook's typing but declining adoption
4. **JSDoc types** - Comments-based typing but limited features

### Decision

Use TypeScript as the primary development language.

### Rationale

- **Type safety**: Compile-time error detection
- **Developer experience**: Excellent IDE support and autocompletion
- **Design token types**: Generate types from tokens automatically
