# React Peer Dependency Resolution - Complete ✅

## Issue Resolved

The peer dependency warning has been successfully resolved:

```
❌ Before: WARN Issues with peer dependencies found
packages/design-system
└─┬ @storybook/addon-essentials 8.6.14
  └─┬ @storybook/addon-docs 8.6.14
    └─┬ react-dom 19.1.0
      └── ✕ unmet peer react@^19.1.0: found 17.0.2 in @loki/runner

✅ After: All React dependencies now use version 19.1.0
```

## Solution Applied

Added pnpm overrides to ensure consistent React version across all dependencies:

```json
{
  "pnpm": {
    "overrides": {
      "react": "19.1.0",
      "react-dom": "19.1.0"
    }
  }
}
```

## Verification

1. **Dependency Resolution**: Confirmed all React dependencies now use version 19.1.0
2. **No Version Conflicts**: React 17.0.2 references completely removed from lock file
3. **Storybook Compatibility**: Storybook runs without peer dependency warnings

## Impact

- ✅ Eliminated peer dependency warnings during installation
- ✅ Ensured consistent React ecosystem across all tools
- ✅ Maintained compatibility with Storybook 8.6.14
- ✅ No impact on Qwik components (they don't depend on React)

## Technical Details

The issue was caused by:

- Storybook requiring React 19.1.0 for its documentation features
- @loki/runner (visual testing tool) having React 17.0.2 in its dependency tree
- No explicit React version pinning in the project

The solution ensures all React-related packages use the same version, eliminating version conflicts while maintaining full functionality.

## Next Steps

The monorepo is now ready for development without peer dependency warnings. All linting tools and development dependencies are working correctly.
